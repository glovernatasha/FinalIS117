                    <p>
                        We were assigned to do a timeline of the internet. While doing the research, I found many interesting things about it. For one, people misuse
                        the term internet for the web.

                        The defintiion for Internet is a network of global exchanges,  including private, public, business, academic and government networks, connected by                guided, wireless fiber-optic technologies. The web is a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser.

                        The history of the Internet extends all the way back to 1958 when BEll Labs developed the first modem.Below is a mini version of the timeline, only including certain dates:

                    <p>
                        1958: Bell Labs creates the modem
                    <p>
                        1969: Arpanet is founded. a.	Arpanet was a military computer network that was used for sharing data long distance. It was developed under ARPA and soon linked four different universities computers together. ARPANET would send information by using packets. The basis for the internet can be traced back to ARPANET
                    <p>
                        1971: Ray Tomlinson sends the first network email a.	Ray Tomlinson sent the first email using a software called “SNDMSG.” He also introduced the “@” symbol to separate the person name and location. Tomlinson sent the first email to a colleague in the same room as him, to check if the software was working properly. To this day, the message within the email has been forgotten.
                    <p>
                        1974: TCP/IP ideas are introduced in a protocol for packet network intercommunication. a.	Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn published A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication. Because many of the existing computers operated on its on hardware and software, it became almost impossible for computers to commutate to each other. Cerf and Kahn created a protocol, TCP, that allowed cross networking. They published their network architecture in May of 1974.
                    <p>
                        1974: the word Internet is coined a.	In Internet Transmission Control Program, internet is first used in the acronym IP, which stands for Internet Protocol.
                    <p>
                        1983: ARPANET adopts TCP/IP a.	ARPANET scientist began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern
                    <p>
                        1984: Domain Name System (DNS) is introduced a.	Paul Mockapetris recognized one problem with ARPANET’s problem with translating addresses into a single table on a single host. He introduced DNS and it become a one of the internet standards n the IETF. Some of the DNS include: .com, .gov and .edu.

                    <h5> 4. How the Internet Workds</h5>


                    <img src="https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/how-the-internet-works_5391f01eeac65.jpg"id="myimage">

                    <p> Many people that use the Internet, do not understand how it works. Below, I've provided my explanation on how it works, including key terms.


                    <p>
                        In order to surf the web, you need a Domain name. A Domain Name is simply the address of the website, in which it can
                        be accessed. For example, lets use NJIT.EDU.
                        When you type NJIT.edu into your browser,

                    <p>
                        1. the browser connects the domain name server and receives the websites IP address
                    <p>
                        2. The browser sends for a HTTP request and checks for the entered webpage
                    <p>
                        3.Once the page is received, if found, the webpage is sent back to the browser. If the webpage is not found a 404 errors pops up(page not found).
                    <p>
                        4.Lastly, the website appears though the browser.
                    </p>


                    How to read a web address: Reading a web address is simple, and a web address(URL) is divided into the parts of:
                    <p>
                        Protocol: the request system used to retrieve the IP address for webpage
                    <p>
                        Domain: The destination
                    <p>
                        Host Name:
                    <p>
                        Domain Name: examples include: .com, .edu,.gov Port: connection for the location
                    <p>
                        Path: represents the path of the package and where ot is stored on the server
                    <p>
                        Query string: a question mark for query Fragment: represent the specifies portion of the same websites.
                    <p>

                        Lets take https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology for example:
                    <p>
                        Protocol: https://
                    <p>
                        Host Name: www.
                    <p>
                        Domain Name: nytimes
                    <p>
                        domain level: .com path: /section/technology




                        How the internet routing works:


                    <p>
                        It is important to note that when sending information across the internet, there is no fixed path! When information is set, it is broken up into many smaller parts called packets. Each packets contains the IP address of the sender and the IP address of the receiver. Now routers come into play. A router acts like a traffic control manager and ensures that the information is receieved the fastest and information is transferred smoothly without interruptions. Another responsibility a router has is called Internet Protocol. Routers keep track of each packet and chooses the cheapest path available. So how does the internet ensures that all information we be receieved? Something called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) comes into play. TCP basically does a check list to see if all packets are received. When TCP checks all packets, information is then displayed in its correct format. But what happens if all the packets are not received? the information will still display, but it may miss some items or not display correctly. When this happens, the webpage will resend the missing packets and go through the process again.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        There are three ways a information is sent over the internet. One way being electricity. This is the most common found and can be
                        founded in many examples such as ethernet cords. While ths option is cheaper, it is very limited in how far
                        information can travel. Another con to having this is the increased loss of signal. Another way is light! Not only is it faster there is no
                        signal loss. Fiber optic cables are wonderful use this use! One con of using light is that its expensive and can become hard to work with.
                        The third way are radio waves. Radio waves are great because they are wireless but signal loss can increase from its use.
                    </p>


                    <h6> 5. Linux </h6>

                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/280px-Tux.svg.png"id="myimage">
                    While creating our websites for the class, we used two distinct Linux commands.
                    SFTP - Stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol. The successor to FTP. Works nearly the same as FTP, but with the added benefit of encrypting the files to prevent outside interference.
                    <p>
                        SSH - Stands for Secure Shell. Works in tandem with STFP by encrypting the network connection from outside threats. Most frequently used when connecting to a server that supports secure connections.


                        We connected to NJIT AFS through a SSH and SFTp connection. From there we were able to edit our websites through webstorm.




                    <h6> 6. HTML & CSS </h6>

                    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*lJ32Bl-lHWmNMUSiSq17gQ.png"id="myimage">

                    <p>
                        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It us the standard language used for making web pages and web applications. When using HTML, it is often paired with CSS and Javascript. It consist of short text and short commands. It was first introduced in the 1990's by Tim Berners-Lee.

                        In order to use HTML without a mess, it is paired with CSS. Cascading Stylesheets, CSS,  are used to control how your pages are presented, and make pages more accessible. Basic special effects and interaction is provided by JavaScript, which adds a lot of power to basic HTML. Most of this advanced stuff is for later down the road, but when using all of these technologies together, you have a lot of power at your disposal.
